# Neighborhood of Actors, Who is the MVP among them?

### Team 8 -  Network Tour of Data Science

### 1. Story

The idea of the project is to find if there exist a community of actors, how they relate among them and who are the most popular actors. 

For this purpose the dataset of IMD will be used, this dataset is downloaded from kaggle :... PUT LINK HERE

The tools that we are going to use for this project are: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Networkx, Matplotlib , etc.

### 2. Acquisition 

The data consisted of : ... description of the data

For the creation of the graph we did this ... 

### 3. Exploration

The first exploration that we did show the following:

* Number of connected components: 2, but then we decided to sparsifiy more the matrix so that is manageable and feasible to use, obtained one connected component 
* Sparisty of the graph: INSERT PLOT HERE
* Diameter: 4, meaning that any actor is 4 steps away of knowing any other actor.
* Degree distribution: INSERT PLOT HERE 
* Spectrum: INSERT PLOT HERE
* Type of graph :
* Properties of the nodes :
* Analysis of the attributes:
* A visualization of the network: I did a simple plot, for this, if elias can improve insert the improved picture here
* A reflection on the insights 

### 4. Exploitation

* Clustering: Spectral clustering findings
* Critical evaluation of the results
